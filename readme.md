## [GAME] Simon !!! How strong is your memory?

#### This is a remake of the [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) game in which you have to remember the colors that will be shown. 
I made this game to test myself on some [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and to brush up my skills on JavaScript. The idea however, came from  a tutorial I was following.

### How to play?
#### This game is relatively easy to understand. You will be shown a color and you have to remember what it is. You are then supposed to click that color. Then once again you will be shown a color, and then you have to click the previous color, and the one recently shown. 
#### For example, you are show the color blue, you will press blue, and then if you are shown yellow, you will press blue and yellow.
